=============

Javascript versions of classic software development algorithms

The goal is to develop (with tests) the following basic data structures:

* Singly Linked List
* Min/Max Binary Heap
* Trie (With Pre-Order Traversal Sorting)
* Stack (push, pop, peek, and isEmpty)
* Queue
* Hash Table

As well as the following algorithms:

* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

Various algorithm problems will be solved using the basic algorithms and data structures to 
showcase how they can be used as well.
