JS-Algorithms
=============

Classic data structures and algorithms written in JavaScript

The goal is to develop (with tests) the following basic data structures:

* Singly Linked List
* Min/Max Binary Heap
* Trie (With Pre-Order Traversal Sorting)
* Stack (push, pop, peek, and isEmpty)
* Queue (add, remove, peek, isEmpty)
* Binary Search Tree
* Hash Table

As well as the following algorithms:

* Breadth First Search
* Depth First Search
* Binary Search
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort

Various problems will be solved to show how to use these basic algorithms and data structures.
